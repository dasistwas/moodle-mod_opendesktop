<p>This feature works only in Firefox. For Internet Explorer adjust the size of your browser-window manually and then start the OpenDesktop.</p>
<p>If you want to have a full-screen display, click on F11 to maximize the browser window and then start your OpenDesktop</p>
<p>This option allows you to choose the size of your OpenDesktop window. If you work with someone with a smaller screen than yours and you choose the whole window-size, your partner will only see a scaled down window of the OpenDesktop. </p>
<p>Therefore we recommend to check if the size of the OpenDesktop window fits in the computer-screen of the persons watching your OpenDesktop. (Choosing the window-size of the participant with the smallest screen would be a good choice.)</p>
